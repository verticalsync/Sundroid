# Sundroid

Sundroid is a fork of [Vendroid](https://github.com/Vencord/Vendroid), Sundroid nor Vendroid is supposed to be used as a main client or anything because of the fact that Discord's mobile site is not very usable since it has many issues. And some people asked me to make Sundroid so here it is.

Discord's mobile site is not very usable since it has many issues. As such, this is mostly just a proof of concept and is not actively worked on.

You are likely better off using [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) or [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta), that are proper mods of the old and new Discord Android app respectively
